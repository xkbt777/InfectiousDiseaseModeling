## Summary

We are going to implement an MPI parallel program that models infectious disease spreading in a big crowd. The basic version would apply a random wandering individual movement model and Gaussian Distribution on the distance between individuals to calculate the infectious rate, combined with a concurrent R-tree to optimize searching individuals within a specific area. A Social Force based movement model and danger area assumption are two feasible extensions on this topic.
